# Mazerunners

## Holiday Maze Dash
**The concept**: Christmas is almost here, and some of Santaâ€™s presents have been scattered throughout mazes. Collect the presents to save Christmas!

**Game play**: The player will play as Santa and navigate procedurally generated mazes while collecting presents. The player must complete their objectives (collect all the presents) and exit the maze to complete the level.

This is a top-down 2D game created using primarily Java and some Python.
